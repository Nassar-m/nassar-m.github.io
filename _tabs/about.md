Hey, I'm Mustafa.

I work in M365 — identity, security, Exchange, the whole stack. Most of what ends up here started as something I had to figure out at work: a config that wasn't obvious, a policy that behaved differently than the docs suggested, or a PowerShell one-liner that took way too long to get right.

Before going into administration I spent a few years at Microsoft Premier Support, which meant sitting with a lot of broken tenants and learning what actually goes wrong in production. These days I'm mostly in Entra ID, Exchange Online, and anything touching Zero Trust or automation.

The posts aren't polished documentation. They're more like notes from someone who went down a rabbit hole and came back with something useful. If it saves you a few hours of searching, that's the whole point.
